Virtual Vault is a Digital Portfolio Management System, powered by cutting-edge technologies to ensure seamless performance and robust functionality:

### Backend:
- Utilizes Express.js to handle API calls and manage database interactions

### Frontend:
- Built with React.js, offering a dynamic and intuitive user interface
- Utilizes state-of-the-art libraries for enhanced user experience and real-time updates

### Database:
- MongoDB used for data storage and retrieval
- Integrates AWS S3 for secure and scalable image storage

### Deployment:
- Hosted on Render for continuous deployment and scalability

***Note: I stopped the S3-bucket and am using static links for product images to prevent idle charges but the code has logic for s3-bucket insertion & retrieval***

As this deployment is free, the backend servers automatically spin down when not in use. Consequently, there may be a brief delay in fetching response from backend such as retrieving products but the servers start back up upon receiving a request.
